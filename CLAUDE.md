## Shared Components
Nav and footer are loaded via JS (`components.js`):
- Every page has `<div id="nav-placeholder"></div>` and `<div id="footer-placeholder"></div>`
- `components.js` fetches `/components/nav.html` and `/components/footer.html`
- Active nav states set via `data-page` attributes on nav links
- Active product category states set via `data-category` attributes
- **Requires local server to test** (use VS Code Live Server extension)

## Nav Structure
- **Primary nav (red bar):** SOUTHERN CGS logo | Home, Industries, Products ▼ (mega menu), Services, Resources, About Us | Book a Meeting (white border), Send an Enquiry (black bg)
- **Secondary nav (grey bar):** Regulators, Valves, Filters, Laboratory Fittings, Accessories
- **Mega menu:** All 5 categories with full subcategories (23 total)

## Product Pages — Google Sheets Powered
- Each product category page has a **left sidebar** (240px) with subcategory links
- **Main grid** (3-column) shows products fetched from Google Sheets
- Clicking sidebar items filters products via JavaScript (show/hide, no page reload)
- **Lightbox** opens on product image click for close-up view
- Product data loaded from Google Sheets: `1dDgP2aJGq3LIOSxUmhWW53f5mTs0EV8mY2wwG4PLy8M`
- Sheet columns: **Name, Description, Category, Subcategory, Image, Spec Sheet**
- Images: paste Google Drive share links (auto-converted to direct URLs)
- Spec Sheets: paste Google Drive PDF share links (auto-converted to preview URLs)
- `product-loader.js` handles fetching, rendering, filtering, and lightbox
- Hardcoded fallback cards hidden while Google Sheets data loads
